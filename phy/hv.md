## 40kV Cascade

The first high voltage cascade was build by using 10nF 2kV capacitors and a series of 3 1N4007 diodes in series.
It has 20 stages resulting in a maximum output voltage of 20kV.
For every stage corona rings were added, even if they are not necessarry at these voltages.

The driver was based using the core of a old flyback transformer, with self winded primary and secondary coils.
It was powered by 2N3055 feedback circuit.
