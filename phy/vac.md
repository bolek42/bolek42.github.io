# Diffusion Pump

A few years ago, i was able to get a cheap refurbished diffusion pump on ebay, which can generate a very high vacuum.
To test the Pump for the first time, some additional parts are required, such as a rotary vacuum pump and some vacuum fittings.
As the pump needs water cooling, a small aquarium pump and a large cup of water was used.
Using a filament from a halogen lamp and a high voltage power supply, a simple diode can be build generating a massive amount of X-rays.
Electrons are emmited from the glowing tungstend wire and are accelerated to the positive plate.
If the vacuum is good enough that the electrons are not slowed down by remaining gas, the assembly should be able to generate some X-rays.
The following foto was taken using a delayed shutter and the high voltage supply was switched on from a safe distance of a couple of meters behind a concrete wall to avoid unnecesarry irradiation.
The geiger counter shows a dose rate of 1.5 mSv/h a couple of centimeters away.

The difference between a low preassure and a high vacuum discharge is shown in the following.
These Pictures were made using glass tube with 4cm diameter, that can be evacuated.
A high positive voltage was applied on the top using the 40kV cascade, wheras the bottom copper tube is grounded.
On the left hand side the diffusion pump is switched off, and the typical cathod rays and positive column are clearly visible.
With the diffusion (right), there are not enough gas molecules left for a gas discharge.
Instead arcing takes place on the inside of the glas tube, due to impurities on the surface.
In addition a small amount of X-rays are generated.

## Iongun (Work in Progress)

As a long term goal for the diffusion pump would be nuclear fusion, and therefore an iongun is one important step for this.
The principle is simple, a glass tube is mounted on a KF flange, with a small hole for the ions to pass through.
In the glass tube itself is a slightly higher preassure, that allow for a gas discharge and therefore to build up free ions.
An external electrical field will be applied to accelerate the ions towards the hole, where some will passi through into the high vacuum chamber.
I needed several attempts to make the assembly airtight.
First I tried to use vacuum grease but in the end I noticed that the holes in the KF flange are slightly too big, so I ended up using epoxy.
The gass is feeded through a copper capillary and a small hole on the side of the tube mount.
The preassure can be regulated with a needle valve, what usually is used for CO2 applications.

The first test were very prommising, weheras the vacuum wasn't ideal.
In fact I wasn't able to open the valve even a bit as the preasure would increase too much.
The main problem was most likely, that the vacuum fittings were slightly dirty or had minor scratches, what could be fixed using vacuum grease.
Event though anode rays are clearly visible.
