# Diffusion Pump

A few years ago, i was able to get a cheap refurbished diffusion pump on ebay, which can generate a very high vacuum.
To test the Pump for the first time, some additional parts are required, such as a rotary vacuum pump and some vacuum fittings.
As the pump needs water cooling, a small aquarium pump and a large cup of water was used.
Using a filament from a halogen lamp and a high voltage power supply, a simple diode can be build generating a massive amount of X-rays.
Electrons are emmited from the glowing tungstend wire and are accelerated to the positive plate.
If the vacuum is good enough that the electrons are not slowed down by remaining gas, the assembly should be able to generate some X-rays.
The following foto was taken using a delayed shutter and the high voltage supply was switched on from a safe distance of a couple of meters behind a concrete wall to avoid unnecesarry irradiation.
The geiger counter shows a dose rate of 1.5 mSv/h a couple of centimeters away.

The difference between a low preassure and a high vacuum discharge is shown in the following.
These Pictures were made using glass tube with 4cm diameter, that can be evacuated.
A high positive voltage was applied on the top using the 40kV cascade, wheras the bottom copper tube is grounded.
On the left hand side the diffusion pump is switched off, and the typical cathod rays and positive column are clearly visible.
With the diffusion (right), there are not enough gas molecules left for a gas discharge.
Instead arcing takes place on the inside of the glas tube, due to impurities on the surface.
In addition a small amount of X-rays are generated.
